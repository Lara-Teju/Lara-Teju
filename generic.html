							<p>Hello! , I'm Tejaswini, a 3rd-year Computer Science student with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’m fascinated by the potential of AI to transform the world, not just in a single industry, but across diverse fields—archaeology, biology, physics, education, and more. The moment that truly solidified my love for AI was when I learned about how scientists used AI and NLP to reconstruct writing from a calcified scroll found in the ruins of Pompeii—without even opening it. To me, that felt like magic, real magic, and I’ve been captivated ever since.<br/><br/>

								What excites me most about AI is its ability to blend science with creativity, much like how I grew up blending my love for drawing and storytelling. With a background in art and mythology, thanks to my mom who is an artist, I’ve always been fascinated by stories—whether they come from ancient mythology or are told through lines of code. This combination of technical problem-solving and artistic thinking has made me an introspective, curious, and optimistic learner. I see technology not just as a tool but as a bridge to better understand people, psychology, and the world.<br/><br/>
								
								Currently, I’m working on a personal project called TextMate, which is very close to my heart. It’s an application that transforms educational PDFs into Cornell-style notes, complete with keywords, summaries, and even analogies for better conceptual understanding. This project has allowed me to combine my love for education and AI, and it represents what I hope to continue doing in the future—using AI to make a meaningful impact across fields that have always excited me.<br/><br/>
								
								Even though I initially chose this field for stability, I never realized I would fall in love with it so quickly, so now I strive to truly contribute to the fields I’ve always loved through this field. Ultimately, I wish to contribute something to this beautiful country I call home, to add to the immensely rich and diverse tapestry that has flowed through the river of space-time.<br/><br/>
								
								I may be a beginner now learning and stumbling at my own pace, but I am driven by curiosity, awe, and a deep passion for learning and understanding. I believe mentorship and collaboration are key to my growth, and I value every opportunity to explore new concepts and ideas. If I had the chance, I’d spend my entire life learning, constantly uncovering the endless possibilities that exist in the world of AI and beyond.
								Because I believe that even though Aristotle said <br/><br/>
								"The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet"<br/><br/>
								Well I want to make those bitter roots sweet as well......</p>
